  Abstract                 = {We address the problem of applying spatial transformations (or "image warps") to diffusion tensor magnetic resonance images. The orientational information that these images contain must be handled appropriately when they are transformed spatially during image registration. We present solutions for global transformations of three-dimensional images up to 12-parameter affine complexity and indicate how our methods can be extended for higher order transformations. Several approaches are presented and tested using synthetic data. One method, the preservation of principal direction algorithm, which takes into account shearing, stretching and rigid rotation, is shown to be the most effective. Additional registration experiments are performed on human brain data obtained from a single subject, whose head was imaged in three different orientations within the scanner. All of our methods improve the consistency between registered and target images over naïve warping algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {Normative data on the in vivo size of the human brain and its major anatomically defined subdivisions are not readily available. In this study, high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure regional brain volumes in 46 normal, right-handed adults (23 men, 23 women) between the ages of 22-49 years. Parcellation of the brain was based on neuroanatomical landmarks. The following brain regions were measured: the cerebral hemispheres, frontal lobe, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, cingulate gyrus, insula, cerebellum, corpus callosum, and lateral ventricles. Males tend to be significantly larger than females, for the whole brain and for nearly all of its major subdivisions, including the corpus callosum. However, the proportional sizes of regions relative to total volume of the hemisphere are remarkably similar in males and females. Variation in size of region is always greater than variation in proportional representation. Asymmetries in brain regions are not profound, with the exception of the cingulate gyrus, which is larger in the left hemisphere. Brain regions are highly correlated in size, with the exception of the lateral ventricles. After controlling for hemisphere size, the volumes of the frontal and parietal lobes are significantly negatively correlated. The occipital lobe tends to be less sexually dimorphic than other major lobes, and less correlated with other brain regions for volume. These results have implications for understanding whether or not certain sectors of the brain have shown relative expansion over the course of hominid and hominoid evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {Using high resolution MRI scans and automated tissue segmentation, gray and white matter (GM, WM) volumes of the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes, cingulate gyrus, and insula were calculated. Subjects included 23 male and 23 female healthy, right-handed subjects. For all structures, male volumes were greater than female, but the gray/white (G/W) ratio was consistently higher across structures in women than men. Sexual dimorphism was greater for WM than GM: most of the G/W ratio sex differences can be attributed to variation in WM volume. The corpus callosum, although larger in men, is less sexually dimorphic than the WM as a whole. Several regions demonstrate pair-wise asymmetries in G/W ratio and WM volume. Both the cingulate gyrus and insula exhibit strong asymmetries. The left cingulate gyrus is significantly larger than the right, and the G/W ratio of the left insula is significantly greater than that of the right. Although statistically significant sex differences and asymmetries are present at this level of analysis, we argue that researchers should be wary of ascribing cognitive functional significance to these patterns at this time. This is not to say, however, that these patterns are not important for understanding the natural history of the human brain, and its evolution and development.},

  Abstract                 = {Asthma is a disease characterized by chronic inflammation and reversible obstruction of the small airways resulting in impaired pulmonary ventilation. Hyperpolarized 3He magnetic resonance (MR) lung imaging is a new technology that provides a detailed image of lung ventilation. Hyperpolarized 3He lung imaging was performed in 10 asthmatics and 10 healthy subjects. Seven asthmatics had ventilation defects distributed throughout the lungs compared with none of the normal subjects. These ventilation defects were more numerous and larger in the two symptomatic asthmatics who had abnormal spirometry. Ventilation defects studied over time demonstrated no change in appearance over 30-60 minutes. One asthmatic subject was studied twice in a three-week period and had ventilation defects which resolved and appeared in that time. This same subject was studied before and after bronchodilator therapy, and all ventilation defects resolved after therapy. Hyperpolarized 3He lung imaging can detect the small, reversible ventilation defects that characterize asthma. The ability to visualize lung ventilation offers a direct method of assessing asthmatics and their response to therapy.},

It is implemented for both 2D and 3D image registration and has been formulated to include an option for estimating inverse consistent deformations. Nonlinear registration is considered as a local optimisation problem, which is solved using a Levenberg-Marquardt strategy. The necessary matrix solutions are obtained in reasonable time using a multigrid method. A constant Eulerian velocity framework is used, which allows a rapid scaling and squaring method to be used in the computations. DARTEL has been applied to intersubject registration of 471 whole brain images, and the resulting deformations were evaluated in terms of how well they encode the shape information necessary to separate male and female subjects and to predict the ages of the subjects.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is about warping a brain image from one subject (the object image) so that it matches another (the template image). A high-dimensional model is used, whereby a finite element approach is employed to estimate translations at the location of each voxel in the template image. Bayesian statistics are used to obtain a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the deformation field. The validity of any registration method is largely based upon the constraints or, in this instance, priors incorporated into the model describing the transformations. In this approach we assume that the priors should have some form of symmetry, in that priors describing the probability distribution of the deformations should be identical to those for the inverses (i.e., warping brain A to brain B should not be different probabilistically from warping B to A). The fundamental assumption is that the probability of stretching a voxel by a factor of n is considered to be the same as the probability of shrinking n voxels by a factor of n(-1). In the Bayesian framework adopted here, the priors are assumed to have a Gibbs form, where the Gibbs potential is a penalty function that embodies this symmetry. The penalty function of choice is based upon the singular values of the Jacobian having a lognormal distribution. This enforces a continuous one-to-one mapping. A gradient descent algorithm is presented that incorporates the above priors in order to obtain a MAP estimate of the deformations. We demonstrate this approach for the two-dimensional case, but the principles can be extended to three dimensions. A number of examples are given to demonstrate how the method works.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a novel method for brain-tissue classification in magnetic resonance (MR) images that relies on a very general, adaptive statistical model of image neighborhoods. The method models MR-tissue intensities as derived from stationary random fields. It models the associated Markov statistics nonparametrically via a data-driven strategy. This paper describes the essential theoretical aspects underpinning adaptive, nonparametric Markov modeling and the theory behind the consistency of such a model. This general formulation enables the method to easily adapt to various kinds of MR images and the associated acquisition artifacts. It implicitly accounts for the intensity nonuniformity and performs reasonably well on T1-weighted MR data without nonuniformity correction. The method minimizes an information-theoretic metric on the probability density functions associated with image neighborhoods to produce an optimal classification. It automatically tunes its important internal parameters based on the information content of the data. Combined with an atlas-based initialization, it is completely automatic. Experiments on real, simulated, and multimodal data demonstrate the advantages of the method over the current state-of-the-art.},

  Abstract                 = {After [15], [31], [19], [8], [25], [5], minimum cut/maximum flow algorithms on graphs emerged as an increasingly useful tool for exact or approximate energy minimization in low-level vision. The combinatorial optimization literature provides many min-cut/max-flow algorithms with different polynomial time complexity. Their practical efficiency, however, has to date been studied mainly outside the scope of computer vision. The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style "push-relabel" methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style "augmenting paths." We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation. In many cases, our new algorithm works several times faster than any of the other methods, making near real-time performance possible. An implementation of our max-flow/min-cut algorithm is available upon request for research purposes.},

The displacement vectors, first and second principal strains, and quantitative ventilation were computed, and mean values were calculated for the upper, middle, and lower lung regions. Displacements in the lower region were significantly greater than those in either the middle or upper region (P < 0.005), while there were no significant differences between the three regions for the two principal strains and quantitative ventilation (P = 0.11-0.92). Variations in principal strains and ventilation were greater between subjects than between lung zones within individual subjects. This technique has the potential to provide insight into regional biomechanical alterations of lung function in a variety of lung diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {Purpose: To measure lung motion between end-inhalation and end-exhalation using a hyperpolarized helium-3 (HP (3)He) magnetic resonance (MR) tagging technique. Methods and Materials: Three healthy volunteers underwent MR tagging studies after inhalation of 1 L HP (3)He gas diluted with nitrogen. Multiple-slice two-dimensional and volumetric three-dimensional MR tagged images of the lungs were obtained at end-inhalation and end-exhalation, and displacement vector maps were computed. Results: The grids of tag lines in the HP (3)He MR images were well defined at end-inhalation and remained evident at end-exhalation. Displacement vector maps clearly demonstrated the regional lung motion and deformation that occurred during exhalation. Discontinuity and differences in motion pattern between two adjacent lung lobes were readily resolved. Conclusions: Hyperpolarized helium-3 MR tagging technique can be used for direct in vivo measurement of respiratory lung motion on a regional basis. This technique may lend new insights into the regional pulmonary biomechanics and thus provide valuable information for the deformable registration of lung.},

  Abstract                 = {Tagged magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is unique in its ability to noninvasively image the motion and deformation of the heart in vivo, but one of the fundamental reasons limiting its use in the clinical environment is the absence of automated tools to derive clinically useful information from tagged MR images. In this paper, we present a novel and fully automated technique based on nonrigid image registration using multilevel free-form deformations (MFFDs) for the analysis of myocardial motion using tagged MRI. The novel aspect of our technique is its integrated nature for tag localization and deformation field reconstruction using image registration and voxel based similarity measures. To extract the motion field within the myocardium during systole we register a sequence of images taken during systole to a set of reference images taken at end-diastole, maximizing the normalized mutual information between the images. We use both short-axis and long-axis images of the heart to estimate the full four-dimensional motion field within the myocardium. We also present validation results from data acquired from twelve volunteers.},

  Abstract                 = {While MR imaging with tagged magnetization has shown great utility in the study of muscle mechanics, the evaluation of pulmonary mechanics has long been hindered by the technical difficulties in MR imaging of lung parenchyma. In this study, a fast MR grid-tagging technique is described for dynamic assessment of regional pulmonary deformation. The method is based on a fast FLASH sequence with short TR and short TE. Tagging was achieved by using double DANTE pulse train or inversion pulses. Our results show that this technique is able to detect changes of the tagging grid caused by physiological deformation of the lung. Quantitative analysis of the data shows that this method is capable of assessing local pulmonary mechanics. The application of this technique could improve our understanding of ventilatory control, and thus provide a unique metric for assessing pulmonary disorders. Magn Reson Med 45:24-28, 2001.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel, fully automatic, adaptive, robust procedure for brain tissue classification from 3D magnetic resonance head images (MRI) is described in this paper. The procedure is adaptive in that it customizes a training set, by using a 'pruning' strategy, such that the classification is robust against anatomical variability and pathology. Starting from a set of samples generated from prior tissue probability maps (a 'model') in a standard, brain-based coordinate system ('stereotaxic space'), the method first reduces the fraction of incorrectly labeled samples in this set by using a minimum spanning tree graph-theoretic approach. Then, the corrected set of samples is used by a supervised kNN classifier for classifying the entire 3D image. The classification procedure is robust against variability in the image quality through a non-parametric implementation: no assumptions are made about the tissue intensity distributions. The performance of this brain tissue classification procedure is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative validation experiments on both simulated MRI data (10 subjects) and real MRI data (43 subjects). A significant improvement in output quality was observed on subjects who exhibit morphological deviations from the model due to aging and pathology.},

  Abstract                 = {Many image matching schemes are based on mapping coordinate locations, such as the locations of landmarks, in one image to corresponding locations in a second image. A new approach to this mapping (coordinate transformation), called the elastic body spline (EBS), is described. The spline is based on a physical model of a homogeneous, isotropic three-dimensional (3-D) elastic body. The model can approximate the way that some physical objects deform. The EBS as well as the affine transformation, the thin plate spline [1], [2] and the volume spline [3] are used to match 3-D magnetic resonance images (MRI's) of the breast that are used in the diagnosis and evaluation of breast cancer. These coordinate transformations are evaluated with different types of deformations and different numbers of corresponding (paired) coordinate locations. In all but one of the cases considered, using the EBS yields more similar images than the other methods.},

Using MR tagging, space is marked with planes which deform with the tissue, providing markers for tracking the local motion of the myocardium. Numerous methods to reconstruct the three-dimensional displacement field have been developed. The aim of this article is to provide a framework to quantitatively compare the performance of four methods the authors have developed. Five sets of experiments are described, and their results are reported. Instructions are also provided to perform similar tests on any method using the same data. The experiments show that some characteristic properties of the methods, such as sensitivity to noise or spatial resolution, can be quantitatively classified. Cross-comparison of performances show what range values for these properties can be considered acceptable.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: A new nonrigid registration method, designed to reduce the effect of movement artifact in subtraction images from breast MR, is compared with existing rigid and affine registration methods. METHOD: Nonrigid registration was compared with rigid and affine registration methods and unregistered images using 54 gadolinium-enhanced 3D breast MR data sets. Twenty-seven data sets had been previously reported normal, and 27 contained a histologically proven carcinoma. The comparison was based on visual assessment and ranking by two radiologists. RESULTS: When analyzed by two radiologists independently, all three registration methods gave better-quality subtraction images than unregistered images (p < 0.01), but nonrigid registration gave significantly better results than the rigid and affine registration methods (p < 0.01). There was no significant difference between rigid and affine registration methods. CONCLUSION: Nonrigid registration significantly reduces the effects of movement artifact in subtracted contrast-enhanced breast MRI. This may enable better visualization of small tumors and those within a glandular breast.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The current guideline for classifying asthma severity, the National Asthma Education Prevention Program (NAEPP) 2002, is not evidence-based. We had the opportunity to validate this guideline in an untreated inner-city population, both in those < or =5 and those >5 years of age. The basis for this retrospective validation model was to determine how well the NAEPP severity classification based on symptom-frequency criteria alone identified patients in those age groups demonstrating significant morbidity the previous year and thus the potential need for controller therapy. METHODS: Using a mobile asthma van (Breathmobile) at the school site, children not receiving controller medication were evaluated by an asthma specialist for severity according to NAEPP guideline clinical criteria. Validation was determined by the relationship of guideline severity to > or =2 emergency department (ED) visits, any hospitalization, health care utilization (any ED visit, hospitalization), number of exacerbations, and school absenteeism resulting from asthma the prior year. RESULTS: Eight hundred twenty-six asthmatic children were evaluated; 89 (10.8\%) were < or =2 years, 222 (26.9\%) were 3 to 5 years, and 515 (62.3\%) were >5 years of age; 60.5\% were male, and 80.9\% were Hispanic. Classification of asthma severity included 34.4\% with mild intermittent, 10.2\% with mild persistent, 31.5\% with moderate persistent, and 24.0\% with severe persistent asthma categories. There were significantly more Hispanic children and children < or =5 years classified as having mild intermittant asthma. Morbidity was clearly related to severity in the overall population. However, although the health care utilization was significantly related to severity, it was borderline in those 3 to 5 years and nonsignificant in children < or =2 years. CONCLUSIONS: The NAEPP guidelines 2002, based on symptom-frequency criteria as assessed in this study, seem to offer a valid basis for classifying asthma severity in those >5 years of age but may underclassify younger children. Our data suggest that morbidity experienced in the prior year may provide a useful additional criterion for classifying asthma severity, particularly in those children < or =5 years of age.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Tagged MRI of the heart is difficult to implement clinically because of the lack of fast analytical techniques. We investigated the accuracy of harmonic phase (HARP) imaging for rapid quantification of myocardial strains and for detailed analysis of left ventricular (LV) function during dobutamine stimulation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Tagged MRI was performed in 10 volunteers at rest and during 5 to 20 microg(-1). kg(-1). min(-1) dobutamine and in 9 postinfarct patients at rest. We compared 2D myocardial strains (circumferential shortening, Ecc; maximal shortening, E(2); and E(2), direction) as assessed by a conventional technique and by HARP. Full quantitative analysis of the data was 10 times faster with HARP. For pooled data, the regression coefficient was r=0.93 for each strain (P<0.001). In volunteers, Ecc and E(2) were greater in the free wall than in the septum (P<0.01), but recruitable myocardial strain at peak dobutamine was greater in the LV septum (P<0.01). E(2) orientation shifted away from the circumferential direction at peak dobutamine (P<0.01). HARP accurately detected subtle changes in myocardial strain fields under increasing doses of dobutamine. In patients, HARP-determined Ecc and E(2) values were dramatically reduced in the asynergic segments as compared with remote (P<0.001), and E(2) direction shifted away from the circumferential direction (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: HARP MRI provides fast, accurate assessment of myocardial strains from tagged MR images in normal subjects and in patients with coronary artery disease with wall motion abnormalities. HARP correctly indexes dobutamine-induced changes in strains and has the potential for on-line quantitative monitoring of LV function during stress testing.},

  Abstract                 = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate a method for quantifying lung motion from the registration of successive images in serial magnetic resonance imaging acquisitions during normal respiration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Estimates of pulmonary motion were obtained by summing the normalized cross-correlation over serially acquired lung images to identify corresponding locations between the images. The estimated motions were modeled as deformations of an elastic body and thus reflect to a first order approximation the true physical behavior of lung parenchyma. The Lagrangian strain, derived from the calculated motion fields, were used to quantify the tissue deformation induced in the lung over the serial acquisition. RESULTS: The method was validated on a magnetic resonance imaging study, for which breath-hold images were acquired of a healthy volunteer at different phases of the respiratory cycle. Regional parenchymal strain was observed to be oriented toward the pulmonary hilum, with strain magnitude maximal at the midcycle of the expiratory phase. CONCLUSION: In vivo magnetic resonance imaging quantification of lung motion holds the potential of providing a new diagnostic dimension in the assessment of pulmonary function, augmenting the information provided by studies of ventilation and perfusion.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review examines the physiologic mechanisms responsible for persistent maximum expiratory airflow limitation in nonsmoking patients with acute and chronic moderate to severe persistent asthma in comparison to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. RECENT FINDINGS: The phenomenon of acute but reversible loss of lung elastic recoil during acute asthma is reviewed, although no plausible pathophysiologic explanation has been offered. Nonsmoking adults with stable asthma and persistent maximum expiratory airflow limitation, despite optimal polytherapy, were shown to have unsuspected and unexplained marked loss of lung elastic recoil in the absence of lung computed tomography scored emphysema. This condition resulted in up to 50\% reduction in maximum expiratory airflow. Furthermore, these patients remain at high risk for adverse clinical events, including near-fatal asthma. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, reduction in maximum expiratory airflow is related to variable extent of loss of lung elastic recoil secondary to emphysema and concurrent intrinsic airway obstruction or obliteration of small airways. There is also an unexplained loss of lung elastic recoil in primary intrinsic small airways disease in the absence of emphysema. SUMMARY: Nonsmoking patients with moderate-severe persistent asthma and patients with smoking-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease share similar physiologic mechanisms of expiratory airflow limitation, but probably caused by different anatomic abnormalities.},

  Abstract                 = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: To investigate the progression and mechanism(s) for fixed maximum expiratory airflow (max) limitation in patients with chronic persistent asthma. METHODS: When optimally treated and in clinically stable condition, we studied 21 asthmatic patients and classified them into three groups based on the severity of expiratory airflow limitation: (1) group A included 5 asthmatic patients (four women; mean +/- SD age, 51 +/- 17 years) with mild persistent asthma (FEV(1) > 80\% predicted) with serial FEV(1) measurements obtained prior to the present study for 16 +/- 4 years; (2) group B included 11 asthmatic patients (three women; mean age, 64 +/- 11 years) with moderate persistent asthma (FEV(1) of 60 to 80\% predicted) with serial FEV(1) measurements for 12 +/- 4 years; and (3) group C included 5 asthmatic patients (three women; mean age, 55 +/- 16 years) with severe persistent asthma (FEV(1) < 60\% predicted) with serial FEV(1) measurements for 11 plus minus 5 years. RESULTS: Lung CT indicated no or trivial emphysema, and diffusion was normal in all asthmatics. There was a marked loss of lung elastic recoil at total lung capacity (TLC) in all asthmatic patients in group B (16 +/- 4 cm H(2)O) and group C (15 +/- 5 cm H(2)O), but none or minimal in group A (22 +/- 1 cm H(2)O) [p < 0.01], and loss of elastic recoil accounted for 34\% and 50\% of decreased maximal expiratory airflow (max) at 80\% and 70\% TLC, respectively. Comparison with previous longitudinal data indicated individual asthmatics when in clinically stable condition remained predominantly in the same FEV(1) percent predicted classification group as in the current study. CONCLUSION: Patients with chronic moderate and severe persistent asthma, despite optimal therapy, have reduced max for many years in part due to (early?) loss of lung elastic recoil from unknown mechanism(s). This challenges current concept of airway remodeling.},

  Abstract                 = {This review emphasizes the mechanisms responsible for maximum expiratory airflow limitation in acute and chronic persistent asthma. The phenomenon of acute but reversible loss of lung elastic recoil during acute asthma is reviewed, although no plausible physiologic explanations are offered. The authors have recently studied adult chronic, stable asthmatics with persistent forced expiratory volume in 1 second less than 80\% predicted, despite optimal polytherapy. The asthmatics had unsuspected marked loss of lung elastic recoil in the absence of emphysema that was responsible for a 32 to 35\% reduction in maximum expiratory airflow at 80\% total lung capacity and a 28 to 60\% reduction in maximum expiratory airflow at 70\% total lung capacity. Work in progress indicates that persistent reduced maximum expiratory airflow may be present for at least 12 +/- 4 years (mean +/- SD) and suggests possible early loss of lung elastic recoil. These observations provide a challenge to the concept of intrinsic airway narrowing resulting from airway remodeling as the major cause of expiratory maximum expiratory airflow limitation in chronic, moderate asthma and severe, persistent asthma. No morphologic or physiologic abnormalities readily explain the chronic, persistent loss of lung recoil.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The assessment of return of function within dysfunctional myocardium after acute myocardial infarction (MI) using contractile reserve has been primarily qualitative. Magnetic resonance (MR) myocardial tagging is a novel noninvasive method that measures intramyocardial function. We hypothesized that MR tagging could be used to quantify the intramyocardial response to low-dose dobutamine and relate this response to return of function in patients after first MI. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty patients with a first reperfused MI (age, 53+/-12 years; 16 male; 11 inferior MIs) were studied. Patients underwent breath-hold MR-tagged short-axis imaging on day 4+/-2 after MI at baseline and during dobutamine infusion at 5 and 10 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1). At 8+/-1 weeks after MI, patients returned for a follow-up MR tagging study without dobutamine. Quantification of percent intramyocardial circumferential segment shortening (\%S) was performed. Low-dose dobutamine MRI was well tolerated. Overall, mean \%S was 15+/-11\% at baseline (n=227 segments), increased to 16+/-10\% at 5 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) dobutamine (P=NS), 21+/-10\% at peak (P<0.0001 versus baseline and 5 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1), and 18+/-10\% at 8 weeks (P<0.004 versus baseline and peak). The increase in \%S with peak dobutamine was greater in dysfunctional myocardium (103 segments, +9+/-10\%) than in normal tissue (124 segments, +4+/-12\%, P<0.0001). In dysfunctional regions, \%S also increased from 6+/-7\% at baseline to 14+/-10\% at 8 weeks after MI (P<0.0001). In dysfunctional regions that responded normally to peak dobutamine (> or =5\% increase in \%S), the increase in \%S from baseline to 8 weeks after MI (+9+/-9\%) was greater than in those regions that did not respond normally (+5+/-9\%, P<0.04). Midmyocardial and subepicardial response to dobutamine were predictive of functional recovery, but the subendocardial response was not. CONCLUSIONS: The response of intramyocardial function to low-dose dobutamine after reperfused MI can be quantified with MR tagging. Dysfunctional tissue after MI demonstrates a larger contractile response to dobutamine than normal myocardium. A normal increase in shortening elicited by dobutamine within dysfunctional midwall and subepicardium predicts greater functional recovery at 8 weeks after MI, but the response within the subendocardium is not predictive.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel method for dynamic ventilation imaging of the full respiratory cycle from four-dimensional computed tomography (4D CT) acquired without added contrast is presented. Three cases with 4D CT images obtained with respiratory gated acquisition for radiotherapy treatment planning were selected. Each of the 4D CT data sets was acquired during resting tidal breathing. A deformable image registration algorithm mapped each (voxel) corresponding tissue element across the 4D CT data set. From local average CT values, the change in fraction of air per voxel (i.e. local ventilation) was calculated. A 4D ventilation image set was calculated using pairs formed with the maximum expiration image volume, first the exhalation then the inhalation phases representing a complete breath cycle. A preliminary validation using manually determined lung volumes was performed. The calculated total ventilation was compared to the change in contoured lung volumes between the CT pairs (measured volume). A linear regression resulted in a slope of 1.01 and a correlation coefficient of 0.984 for the ventilation images. The spatial distribution of ventilation was found to be case specific and a 30\% difference in mass-specific ventilation between the lower and upper lung halves was found. These images may be useful in radiotherapy planning.},

  Abstract                 = {The accuracy of image-guided neurosurgery generally suffers from brain deformations due to intraoperative changes. These deformations cause significant changes of the anatomical geometry (organ shape and spatial interorgan relations), thus making intraoperative navigation based on preoperative images error prone. In order to improve the navigation accuracy, we developed a biomechanical model of the human head based on the finite element method, which can be employed for the correction of preoperative images to cope with the deformations occurring during surgical interventions. At the current stage of development, the two-dimensional (2-D) implementation of the model comprises two different materials, though the theory holds for the three-dimensional (3-D) case and is capable of dealing with an arbitrary number of different materials. For the correction of a preoperative image, a set of homologous landmarks must be specified which determine correspondences. These correspondences can be easily integrated into the model and are maintained throughout the computation of the deformation of the preoperative image. The necessary material parameter values have been determined through a comprehensive literature study. Our approach has been tested for the case of synthetic images and yields physically plausible deformation results. Additionally, we carried out registration experiments with a preoperative MR image of the human head and a corresponding postoperative image simulating an intraoperative image. We found that our approach yields good prediction results, even in the case when correspondences are given in a relatively small area of the image only.},

In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework, based on global and local measures of the relevance of the registration. We have chosen to focus more particularly on the matching of cortical areas, since intersubject registration methods are dedicated to anatomical and functional normalization, and also because other groups have shown the relevance of such registration methods for deep brain structures. Experiments were conducted using 6 methods on a database of 18 subjects. The global measures used show that the quality of the registration is directly related to the transformation's degrees of freedom. More surprisingly, local measures based on the matching of cortical sulci did not show significant differences between rigid and non rigid methods.},

  Abstract                 = {To assess awareness and understanding of obstructive airway diseases by primary-care physicians, the authors surveyed a randomly selected population of 75 primary care practitioners. During one-on-one interviews, physicians were presented with a standardized case scenario and a subsequent series of open-ended questions concerning asthma and COPD. Each respondent was presented in randomized fashion with one of two versions of a case description of a hypothetical 52-year-old male smoker with a recent upper respiratory tract infection and persistent productive cough. The only difference between case descriptions was that one included explicit reference to an earlier tentative diagnosis of chronic bronchitis (CB version); the other description made no specific mention of this diagnostic term (NCB version). Chest radiographs were requested by 80 percent of physicians and sputum cultures by 50 percent, these percentages not differing significantly between CB and NCB groups. Spirometry was requested less often than either of the foregoing tests (21 percent). The CB group requested spirometry significantly more often than the NCB group (38 percent vs 5 percent, p < 0.05). The most frequently mentioned primary diagnosis was bronchitis/pneumonia (33 percent), followed by bronchitis (28 percent) and chronic bronchitis (16 percent), all of which were similar in both groups. However, the diagnostic term "COPD" was the primary diagnosis in 16 percent of the CB group, compared with 8 percent in the NCB group (p > 0.05). Oral antibiotics were the most frequently chosen first-line drug therapy (63 percent). In subsequent questions concerning the management of obstructive airway diseases, primary practitioners distinguished COPD from asthma conceptually, but their prescribed therapy for the two disorders was less distinct. beta 2-agonists were selected most frequently and similarly as initial therapy for both disorders (53 percent). Minor differences between first-line therapeutic choices included nonsignificant trends toward the more frequent mention of anticholinergic bronchodilators for COPD than for asthma (10 percent vs 0 percent) and the more frequent selection of inhaled corticosteroids for asthma (12 percent vs 5 percent). The authors conclude that to the extent that questionnaire responses reflect actual practice, primary care practitioners (1) have a low index of suspicion for obstructive airway disease, (2) markedly underutilized spirometry as a screening tool, (3) consider beta 2-agonists first-line therapy for COPD and asthma, and (4) despite considering COPD and asthma different disease processes, choose similar medications for each disorder.},

  Abstract                 = {All fields of neuroscience that employ brain imaging need to communicate their results with reference to anatomical regions. In particular, comparative morphometry and group analysis of functional and physiological data require coregistration of brains to establish correspondences across brain structures. It is well established that linear registration of one brain to another is inadequate for aligning brain structures, so numerous algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains to one another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever conducted. Fourteen algorithms from laboratories around the world are evaluated using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brains were performed by algorithms including: AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, JRD-fluid, ROMEO, SICLE, SyN, and four different SPM5 algorithms ("SPM2-type" and regular Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the DARTEL Toolbox). All of these registrations were preceded by linear registration between the same image pairs using FLIRT. One of the most significant findings of this study is that the relative performances of the registration methods under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice of subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap measure. This is important because it suggests that the findings are generalizable to new subject populations that are labeled or evaluated using different labeling protocols. Furthermore, we ranked the 14 methods according to three completely independent analyses (permutation tests, one-way ANOVA tests, and indifference-zone ranking) and derived three almost identical top rankings of the methods. ART, SyN, IRTK, and SPM's DARTEL Toolbox gave the best results according to overlap and distance measures, with ART and SyN delivering the most consistently high accuracy across subjects and label sets.

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: To investigate regional airways obstruction in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) with quantitative analysis of dynamic hyperpolarized (HP) (3)He MRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dynamic radial projection MRI of HP (3)He gas was used to study respiratory dynamics in a group of eight children with CF. Signal kinetics in a total of seven regions of interest (ROIs; three in each lung, and one in the trachea) were compared with the results of spirometric pulmonary function tests (PFTs). The tracheal signal intensity was used as a form of "input function" to normalize for input flow effects. RESULTS: A pattern of low flow rate in the upper lobes was observed. When the flow measurements from the peripheral ROIs were averaged to obtain an index of flow in the peripheral lung, a good correlation was found (P = 3.74 x 10(-5)) with the forced expired volume in one second (FEV1). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a quantitative measurement of localized airways obstruction in the early stages of CF may be obtained from dynamic (3)He MRI by using the slope of the signal rise as a measure of air flow into the peripheral lung. This study also demonstrates that children can cooperate well with the (3)He MRI technique.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the value of high-dose dobutamine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) with myocardial tagging for the detection of wall motion abnormalities as a measure of myocardial ischemia in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two hundred eleven consecutive patients with chest pain underwent dobutamine-CMR 4 days after antianginal medication was stopped. Dobutamine-CMR was performed at rest and during increasing doses of dobutamine. Cine-images were acquired during breath-hold with and without myocardial tagging at 3 short-axis levels. Regional wall motion was assessed in a 16-segment short-axis model. Patients with new wall motion abnormalities (NWMA) were examined by coronary angiography. Dobutamine-CMR was successfully performed in 194 patients. Dobutamine-CMR without tagging detected NWMA in 58 patients, whereas NWMA were detected in 68 patients with tagging (P=0.002, McNemar). Coronary angiography showed coronary artery disease in 65 (96\%) of these 68 patients. All but 3 of the 65 patients needed revascularization. In the 112 patients with a negative dobutamine-CMR study, without baseline wall motion abnormalities, the cardiovascular occurrence-free survival rate was 98.2\% during the mean follow-up period of 17.3 months (range, 7 to 31). CONCLUSIONS: Dobutamine-CMR with myocardial tagging detected more NWMA compared with dobutamine-CMR without tagging and reliably separated patients with a normal life expectancy from those at increased risk of major adverse cardiac events.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Accurate characterization of asthma severity is difficult due to the variability of symptoms. Hyperpolarized helium-3 MRI (H(3)HeMR) is a new technique in which the airspaces are visualized, depicting regions with airflow obstruction as "ventilation defects." The objective of this study was to compare the extent of H(3)HeMR ventilation defects with measures of asthma severity and spirometry. METHODS: Patients with a physician diagnosis of asthma and normal control subjects underwent H(3)HeMR. For each person, the number and size of ventilation defects were scored and the average number of ventilation defects per slice (VDS) was calculated. The correlations of the imaging findings with measures of asthma severity and spirometry were determined. RESULTS: There were 58 patients with asthma (mild-intermittent, n = 13; mild-persistent, n = 13; moderate-persistent, n = 20; and severe-persistent, n = 12) and 18 control subjects. Mean +/- SE VDS for asthmatics was significantly greater than for control subjects (0.99 +/- 0.15 vs 0.26 +/- 0.22, p = 0.004). Among asthmatics, VDS was significantly higher for the group with moderate-persistent and severe-persistent disease than for the group with mild-intermittent and mild-persistent disease (1.37 +/- 0.24 vs 0.53 +/- 0.12, p < 0.001). VDS correlated significantly with FEV(1)/FVC (r = - 0.51, p = 0.002), forced expiratory flow between 25\% and 75\% from the beginning of FVC (FEF(25-75\%)) percentage of predicted for height, sex, and race (\%predicted) [r = - 0.50, p = 0.001], and FEV(1) \%predicted (r = - 0.40, p = 0.002), but not with FVC \%predicted (r = - 0.26, p = 0.057) and peak expiratory flow \%predicted (r = - 0.16, p = 0.231). Many asthmatics had an elevated VDS, but their spirometric indexes, except FEF(25\%-75\%), were normal. Most ventilation defects were < 3 cm in size for all asthmatics. In the group of patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma, there were more defects > or =3 cm than in the group with mild-intermittent and mild-persistent disease (p = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: Regional changes of airflow obstruction in asthmatics depicted by H(3)HeMR correlate with measures of asthma severity and spirometry.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether focal changes of airflow obstruction within the lungs of patients with asthma vary or are fixed in location with time or repeated bronchoconstriction. With hyperpolarized helium-3 magnetic resonance (H(3)HeMR) imaging, the airspaces are depicted and focal areas of airflow obstruction are shown as "ventilation defects." OBJECTIVE: To investigate the regional changes of airflow obstruction with time and repeated bronchoconstriction. METHODS: H(3)HeMR and spirometry were performed before (pre) and immediately after (post) methacholine challenge in 10 young patients with asthma on 2 days that were 7-476 days (mean, 185.3 +/- 37.2 days) apart. Pair-wise image comparisons were performed to determine the change in location of ventilation defects within the lung and their change in size. RESULTS: When comparing premethacholine versus premethacholine and postmethacholine versus post-methacholine images of the 2 days, 41\% +/- 10\% and 69\% +/- 5\% (P = .017) of defects, respectively, were in the same location, and of those, 69\% +/- 12\% and 43\% +/- 5\% (P = .022), respectively, did not change size. Comparing premethacholine versus postmethacholine images, 58\% +/- 9\% of defects were in the same location on day 1 and 73\% +/- 7\% (P = .088) on day 2. On both days, the percent increase in defect number from premethacholine to postmethacholine was much greater than the percent decrease in spirometric values (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Many of the ventilation defects persisted or recurred in the same location with time or repeated bronchoconstriction, suggesting that the regional changes of airflow obstruction are relatively fixed within the lung. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The findings give new insight into the regional airflow variability within the lungs of patients with asthma.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a model-based method for fully automated bias field correction of MR brain images. The MR signal is modeled as a realization of a random process with a parametric probability distribution that is corrupted by a smooth polynomial inhomogeneity or bias field. The method we propose applies an iterative expectation-maximization (EM) strategy that interleaves pixel classification with estimation of class distribution and bias field parameters, improving the likelihood of the model parameters at each iteration. The algorithm, which can handle multichannel data and slice-by-slice constant intensity offsets, is initialized with information from a digital brain atlas about the a priori expected location of tissue classes. This allows full automation of the method without need for user interaction, yielding more objective and reproducible results. We have validated the bias correction algorithm on simulated data and we illustrate its performance on various MR images with important field inhomogeneities. We also relate the proposed algorithm to other bias correction algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {Registration of multidate or multisensor images is an essential process in many image processing applications including remote sensing, medical image analysis, and computer vision. Control point (CP) and intensity are the two basic features used separately for image registration in the literature. In this paper, an exact maximum likelihood (EML) registration method, which combines both CP and intensity, is proposed for image alignment. The EML registration method maximizes the likelihood function based CP and intensity to estimate the registration parameters, including affine transformation and CP coordinates. The explicit formulas of the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) are also derived for the proposed EML and conventional image registration algorithms. The performances of these image registration techniques are evaluated with the CRBs.},

The statistics of the classification show definite trends in the evolving registration techniques, which will be discussed. At this moment, the bulk of interesting intrinsic methods is based on either segmented points or surfaces, or on techniques endeavouring to use the full information content of the images involved.},

  Abstract                 = {Assessment of myocardial mechanics is an integral part of understanding and predicting heart disease. This review covers the two most common magnetic resonance (MR) methods used to measure myocardial motion: myocardial tagging and myocardial velocity mapping. Myocardial tagging has been well established in clinical research, despite its time-consuming postprocessing procedure. Myocardial velocity mapping uses the phase shifts of the spins to encode the velocity into the MR signal. This means that once the myocardial contours have been segmented, the data can be automatically processed to obtain quantitative measurements. Diffusion MR also has found applications in cardiac imaging, with preliminary results of myocardial fiber architecture being obtained recently. These three different MR techniques have provided valuable insights into the assessment of intrinsic cardiac mechanics. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2000;12:873-883.},

  Abstract                 = {We have implemented and validated an algorithm for three-dimensional positron emission tomography transmission-to-computed tomography registration in the chest, using mutual information as a similarity criterion. Inherent differences in the two imaging protocols produce significant nonrigid motion between the two acquisitions. A rigid body deformation combined with localized cubic B-splines is used to capture this motion. The deformation is defined on a regular grid and is parameterized by potentially several thousand coefficients. Together with a spline-based continuous representation of images and Parzen histogram estimates, our deformation model allows closed-form expressions for the criterion and its gradient. A limited-memory quasi-Newton optimization algorithm is used in a hierarchical multiresolution framework to automatically align the images. To characterize the performance of the method, 27 scans from patients involved in routine lung cancer staging were used in a validation study. The registrations were assessed visually by two expert observers in specific anatomic locations using a split window validation technique. The visually reported errors are in the 0- to 6-mm range and the average computation time is 100 min on a moderate-performance workstation.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a new approach to medical image analysis that combines deformable model methodologies with concepts from the field of artificial life. In particular, we propose "deformable organisms", autonomous agents whose task is the automatic segmentation, labeling, and quantitative analysis of anatomical structures in medical images. Analogous to natural organisms capable of voluntary movement, our artificial organisms possess deformable bodies with distributed sensors, as well as (rudimentary) brains with motor, perception, behavior, and cognition centers. Deformable organisms are perceptually aware of the image analysis process. Their behaviors, which manifest themselves in voluntary movement and alteration of body shape, are based upon sensed image features, pre-stored anatomical knowledge, and a deliberate cognitive plan. We demonstrate several prototype deformable organisms based on a multiscale axisymmetric body morphology, including a "corpus callosum worm" that can overcome noise, incomplete edges, considerable anatomical variation, and interference from collateral structures to segment and label the corpus callosum in 2D mid-sagittal MR brain images.},

Eight patients with stable CF prospectively underwent 3He MRI, HRCT, and spirometry within 1 week. Three-dimensional (3D) gradient-echo sequence was used during an 18-s breath-hold following inhalation of hyperpolarized 3He. Each lung was divided into six zones; 3He MRI was scored as percentage ventilation per lung zone. HRCT was scored using a modified Bhalla scoring system. Univariate (Spearman rank) and multivariate correlations were performed between 3He MRI, HRCT, and spirometry. Results are expressed as mean+/-SD (range). Spirometry is expressed as percent predicted. There were four men and four women, mean age = 31.9+/-9 (20-46). Mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV)1 = 52\%+/-29 (27-93). Mean 3He MRI score = 74\%+/-25 (55-100). Mean HRCT score = 48.8+/-24 (13.5-83). The correlation between 3He MRI and HRCT was strong (R = +/-0.89, p < 0.001). Bronchiectasis was the only independent predictor of 3He MRI; 3He MRI correlated better with FEV1 and forced vital capacity (FVC) (R = 0.86 and 0.93, p < 0.01, respectively) than HRCT (R = +/-0.72 and +/-0.81, p < 0.05, respectively). This study showed that 3He MRI correlates strongly with structural HRCT abnormalities and is a stronger correlate of spirometry than HRCT in CF.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one subjects, 16 healthy volunteers and 15 patients with CF, underwent HHe lung ventilation MR imaging and spirometry at baseline. Eight patients with CF then were treated with nebulized albuterol, after which a follow-up HHe MR scan was obtained. Subsequently, recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (DNase) treatment and chest physical therapy were performed in these eight subjects, followed by a third HHe MR scan. For each MR study, the number of ventilation defects was scored by a human reader. RESULTS: Patients with CF had significantly more HHe MR ventilation defects per image than healthy subjects (mean, 8.2 defects in patients with CF vs 1.6 defects in healthy subjects; P < .05). Even the four subjects with CF with a normal forced expiratory volume in 1 second had significantly more ventilation defects than healthy subjects (mean, 6.5 defects in these patients with CF; P = .0002). After treatment with albuterol, there was a small, but statistically significant, decrease in number of ventilation defects (mean, 9.6-8.0 defects; P = .025). After DNase and chest physical therapy, there was a trend toward increasing ventilation defects (mean, 8.3 defects; P = .096), but with a residual net improvement relative to baseline. CONCLUSION: In patients with CF, HHe MR ventilation defects correlate with spirometry, change with treatment, and are elevated in number in patients with CF with normal spirometry results. Thus, HHe MR appears to possess many of the characteristics required of a biomarker for pulmonary CF and may be useful in the evaluation of CF pulmonary disease severity or progression.},

The model of CA is a Grenander deformable template, an orbit generated from a template under groups of diffeomorphisms. The metric space of all anatomical images is constructed from the geodesic connecting one anatomical structure to another in the orbit. The variational problems specifying these metrics are reviewed along with their associated Euler-Lagrange equations. The Euler equations of motion derived by Arnold for the geodesics in the group of divergence-free volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of incompressible fluids are generalized for the larger group of diffeomorphisms used in CA with nonconstant Jacobians. Metrics that accommodate photometric variation are described extending the anatomical model to incorporate the construction of neoplasm. Metrics on landmarked shapes are reviewed as well as Joshi's diffeomorphism metrics, Bookstein's thin-plate spline approximate-metrics, and Kendall's affine invariant metrics. We conclude by showing recent experimental results from the Toga & Thompson group in growth, the Van Essen group in macaque and human cortex mapping, and the Csernansky group in hippocampus mapping for neuropsychiatric studies in aging and schizophrenia.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: To demonstrate ventilation changes in an animal model of methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction using hyperpolarized (HP) helium-3 (He-3) MRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bronchoconstriction was induced in 11 healthy rats using an intravenous injection of methacholine. The He-3 was laser-polarized using a custom-built system. MRI studies were performed on a 2-Tesla bore magnet. Coronal dynamic ventilation images were obtained using a single inhalation of the laser-polarized He-3 gas before and after methacholine injection. Ventilation image series were processed on a pixel-by-pixel basis to generate three regional ventilation parameters: gas flow rate, filling time, and maximum gas volume. Student's paired t-test was used for analysis. RESULTS: Ventilation image series with a temporal resolution of 5 msec were obtained before and after methacholine challenge. Quantitative regional gas dynamic information demonstrated statistically significant differences between the baseline and constricted states. Following methacholine injection, the mean flow values were significantly lower for the right lung (RL) (P = 0.006) and left lung (LL) (P = 0.024), while the mean filling time was found to be greater (RL: P = 0.08, LL: P = 0.021). Gas volume values at maximum inspiration were found to be significantly lower after methacholine (RL: P = 0.002; LL: P = 0.036). CONCLUSION: He-3 MRI demonstrated and quantified regional ventilation changes in bronchoconstriction conditions in rats.},

  Abstract                 = {In this work the effects of noise, resolution, and velocity (flow) on the measurement of intravascular pressure from phase-contrast (PC) MRI are discussed. To elucidate these effects, we employed an axisymmetric geometry that enabled us to calculate pressures in <2 min on a Sun Ultra SPARC 10 workstation. To determine the effects of vascular stenoses, we fabricated several stenotic phantom geometries (with 50\%, 75\%, and 90\% area stenoses), and performed both MRI and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for various flow rates for these phantom geometries. Noise with Gaussian statistics was added to the velocity field obtained from the CFD simulations. The pressure maps obtained directly from CFD simulations for our phantom geometries were compared with pressure maps derived by our algorithm when 1) the input was noise-corrupted velocity data from CFD, and 2) the input was PC-MRI data collected from the phantoms. The quantitative effects of noise, resolution, and flow rate on the accuracy of pressure measurements were determined. We found that for flow rates below the Reynolds number for turbulent flow, resolution is a more significant determinant of accuracy than SNR. Furthermore, if other parameters remain constant, increased flow rates may result in decreased accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to prospectively see if quantitative computed tomography (QCT) could separate asthmatic patients from normal control subjects. The QCT results were also correlated with the pulmonary function tests (PFT) that were done on both the asthmatic patients and control subjects. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Eighteen adult nonsmoking asthmatics and 22 adult control subjects were entered into the study. Quantitative CT was performed at the level of the transverse aorta and just above the diaphragm at both end inspiration and end expiration in all patients and control subjects: 10-mm and 1.5-mm collimation using a high spatial frequency algorithm was used to obtain the QCT examinations. The percent of pixels below -900 Hounsfeld units, pixel index, in each of the QCT axial images of the lungs was calculated for each asthmatic and control subject in the study. Pulmonary function testing was performed on both the asthmatics and control subjects and included determination of FEV1, FVC, FRC, RV, and TLC. Unpaired Student's t test analysis of the QCT data was done to statistically compare the asthmatics with the control subjects. Linear regression analysis was done to compare the QCT results with PFT data on the asthmatics and control subjects. RESULTS: When scans were performed at end expiration, at a level immediately superior to the diaphragm, the mean pixel index was significantly higher in asthmatic subjects compared with normal individuals on both CT (mean for normal subjects 0.16 vs 4.45 for asthmatics, p < 0.004) and high-resolution CT (HRCT) images (mean for normal subjects 1.04 vs 10.03 in asthmatics, p < 0.0001) indicating more areas of low attenuation in asthmatics. The CT and HRCT images from the lower lung zones that were performed at end expiration provided the best separation between the groups. The pixel index on expiration correlated with the degree of air trapping and airflow limitation in the asthmatic group based on FEV1, FRC, RV, and to a lesser extent, FVC. CONCLUSION: Expiratory QCT is a useful method to assess air trapping in asthmatic patients. The percent of abnormal lung in asthmatics as determined by QCT has a significant correlation with the PFTs that reflect air trapping in asthmatic patients. Quantitative CT may be helpful in assessing degrees of air trapping present in other diseases affecting the airways.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: To reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) myocardial deformations from orthogonal sets of parallel-tagged magnetic resonance (MR) images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Displacement information in the direction normal to the undeformed tag planes was obtained at points along tag lines. Three independent sets of one-dimensional displacement data were used to fit an analytical series expression to describe 3D displacement as a function of deformed position. The technique was demonstrated with computer-generated models of the deformed left ventricle with data from healthy human volunteers. RESULTS: Model deformations were reconstructed with a 3D tracking error of less than 0.3 mm. Error between estimated and observed one-dimensional displacements along the tags in 10 human subjects was 0.00 mm +/- 0.36 (mean +/- standard deviation). Robustness to noise in the tag displacement data was demonstrated by using a Monte Carlo simulation. CONCLUSION: The combination of rapidly acquired parallel-tagged MR images and field-fitting analysis is a valuable tool in cardiac mechanics research and in the clinical assessment of cardiac mechanical function.},

The method is based on the use of isolated spectral peaks in spatial modulation of magnetization (SPAMM)-tagged magnetic resonance images. We call the calculated angle of the complex image corresponding to one of these peaks a harmonic phase (HARP) image and show that HARP images can be used to synthesize conventional tag lines, reconstruct displacement fields for small motions, and calculate two-dimensional (2-D) strain. The performance of this new approach is demonstrated using both real and simulated tagged MR images. Potential for use of HARP images in fast imaging techniques and three-dimensional (3-D) analyses are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Airways remodelling is a feature of longstanding asthma, but may differ in persons with allergic and nonallergic asthma. To assess airways remodelling indirectly, we compared permanent CT-scan abnormalities in 70 subjects with allergic (median age: 30 yr) and 56 with nonallergic asthma (median age: 54.5 yr) who had had asthma of similar duration. None of the subjects were smokers. Asthma severity was assessed by Aas score and FEV1. Permanent high-resolution computed tomographic (HR-CT) scan abnormalities were characterized. In comparison with allergic asthmatic subjects, those with nonallergic asthma had a significantly greater frequency of cylindric (p < 0.0007, Mann-Whitney U test) and varicose (p < 0.004) bronchiectasis, emphysema (p < 0.0003), bronchial recruitment (p < 0.0001), and sequellar linear shadows (p < 0.0001). There was a significant correlation between Aas score and emphysema (p < 0.0001 for nonallergic and p < 0.0005 for allergic asthma; Kendall's test method) or Aas score and sequellar linear shadows (p < 0.007, nonallergic asthma). There was a significant increase in the extent of permanent abnormalities with increasing severity and duration of asthma in both groups. Patients with brittle asthma had few permanent abnormalities. This study confirms that after a similar course of the disease, patients with nonallergic asthma have a more extensive remodelling of the airways than those with allergic asthma.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE:: Hyperpolarized He magnetic resonance imaging (He MRI) at 3.0 Tesla of healthy volunteers and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients was performed for quantitative evaluation of ventilation defects and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) and for comparison to published results acquired at 1.5 Tesla. The reproducibility of He ADC and ventilation defects was also assessed in subjects scanned 3 times, twice within 10 minutes, and again within 7 +/- 2 days of the first MRI visit. MATERIALS AND METHODS:: Hyperpolarized He MRI was performed in 6 subjects. Two interleaved images with and without additional diffusion sensitization were acquired with the first image serving as a ventilation image from which defect score and volume were measured and the combination of the 2 images used to compute ADC maps and ADC histograms. RESULTS:: He MRI at 3.0 Tesla showed increased mean ADC and ADC standard deviation for subjects with COPD compared with healthy volunteers (ADC healthy volunteer (0.24 +/- 0.12 cm/s), mild-moderate COPD (0.34 +/- 0.14 cm/s), and severe COPD (0.47 +/- 0.21 cm/s), and these values were similar to previously reported results acquired at 1.5 Tesla. Reproducibility of mean ADC was high (coefficient of variation 2\% in severe COPD, 3\% in mild-moderate COPD, 4\% in healthy volunteers) across all 3 scans. Higher same-day scan reproducibility was observed for ventilation defect volume compared with 1-week scan reproducibility in this small group of subjects. CONCLUSIONS:: ADC values for emphysematous lungs were significantly increased compared with healthy lungs in age-matched subjects, and all values were comparable to those reported previously at 1.5 Tesla. Ventilation defect score and ventilation defect volume results were also comparable to results previously reported in COPD subjects Reproducibility of ADC for same-day scan-rescan and 7-day rescan was high and similar to previously reported results.},

  Abstract                 = {A comparison of six similarity measures for use in intensity-based two-dimensional-three-dimensional (2-D-3-D) image registration is presented. The accuracy of the similarity measures are compared to a "gold-standard" registration which has been accurately calculated using fiducial markers. The similarity measures are used to register a computed tomography (CT) scan of a spine phantom to a fluoroscopy image of the phantom. The registration is carried out within a region-of-interest in the fluoroscopy image which is user defined to contain a single vertebra. Many of the problems involved in this type of registration are caused by features which were not modeled by a phantom image alone. More realistic "gold-standard" data sets were simulated using the phantom image with clinical image features overlaid. Results show that the introduction of soft-tissue structures and interventional instruments into the phantom image can have a large effect on the performance of some similarity measures previously applied to 2-D-3-D image registration. Two measures were able to register accurately and robustly even when soft-tissue structures and interventional instruments were present as differences between the images. These measures were pattern intensity and gradient difference. Their registration accuracy, for all the rigid-body parameters except for the source to film translation, was within a root-mean-square (rms) error of 0.54 mm or degrees to the "gold-standard" values. No failures occurred while registering using these measures.},

  Abstract                 = {A measure for registration of medical images that currently draws much attention is mutual information. The measure originates from information theory, but has been shown to be successful for image registration as well. Information theory, however, offers many more measures that may be suitable for image registration. These all measure the divergence of the joint distribution of the images' grey values from the joint distribution that would have been found had the images been completely independent. This paper compares the performance of mutual information as a registration measure with that of other F-information measures. The measures are applied to rigid registration of positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance (MR) and MR/computed tomography (CT) images, for 35 and 41 image pairs, respectively. An accurate gold standard transformation is available for the images, based on implanted markers. The registration performance, robustness and accuracy of the measures are studied. Some of the measures are shown to perform poorly on all aspects. The majority of measures produces results similar to those of mutual information. An important finding, however, is that several measures, although slightly more difficult to optimize, can potentially yield significantly more accurate results than mutual information.},

The aim of the survey is threefold: an introduction for those new to the field, an overview for those working in the field, and a reference for those searching for literature on a specific application. Methods are classified according to the different aspects of mutual-information-based registration. The main division is in aspects of the methodology and of the application. The part on methodology describes choices made on facets such as preprocessing of images, gray value interpolation, optimization, adaptations to the mutual information measure, and different types of geometrical transformations. The part on applications is a reference of the literature available on different modalities, on interpatient registration and on different anatomical objects. Comparison studies including mutual information are also considered. The paper starts with a description of entropy and mutual information and it closes with a discussion on past achievements and some future challenges.},

A finite element mesh of the LV was constructed to fit the geometry of the wall. The mesh was deformed by optimizing the nodal parameters to the motion of a sparse number of fiducial markers that were manually tracked in the images through the cardiac cycle. A parameter distribution model (PDM) of LV deformations was obtained from a database of MR tagging studies. This was used to filter the calculated deformation and incorporate a priori information on likely motions. The estimated deformation obtained from 13 normal untagged studies was compared with the deformation obtained from MR tagging. The end systolic (ES) circumferential and longitudinal strain values matched well with a mean difference of 0.1 +/- 3.2\% and 0.3 +/- 3.0\%, respectively. The calculated apex-base twist angle at ES had a mean difference of 1.0 +/- 2.3 degrees. We conclude that fiducial marker fitting in conjunction with a PDM provides accurate reconstruction of LV deformation in normal subjects.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we extend a previously reported intensity-based nonrigid registration algorithm by using a novel regularization term to constrain the deformation. Global motion is modeled by a rigid transformation while local motion is described by a free-form deformation based on B-splines. An information theoretic measure, normalized mutual information, is used as an intensity-based image similarity measure. Registration is performed by searching for the deformation that minimizes a cost function consisting of a weighted combination of the image similarity measure and a regularization term. The novel regularization term is a local volume-preservation (incompressibility) constraint, which is motivated by the assumption that soft tissue is incompressible for small deformations and short time periods. The incompressibility constraint is implemented by penalizing deviations of the Jacobian determinant of the deformation from unity. We apply the nonrigid registration algorithm with and without the incompressibility constraint to precontrast and post-contrast magnetic resonance (MR) breast images from 17 patients. Without using a constraint, the volume of contrast-enhancing lesions decreases by 1\%-78\% (mean 26\%). Image improvement (motion artifact reduction) obtained using the new constraint is compared with that obtained using a smoothness constraint based on the bending energy of the coordinate grid by blinded visual assessment of maximum intensity projections of subtraction images. For both constraints, volume preservation improves, and motion artifact correction worsens, as the weight of the constraint penalty term increases. For a given volume change of the contrast-enhancing lesions (2\% of the original volume), the incompressibility constraint reduces motion artifacts better than or equal to the smoothness constraint in 13 out of 17 cases (better in 9, equal in 4, worse in 4). The preliminary results suggest that incorporation of the incompressibility regularization term improves intensity-based free-form nonrigid registration of contrast-enhanced MR breast images by greatly reducing the problem of shrinkage of contrast-enhancing structures while simultaneously allowing motion artifacts to be substantially reduced.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider elastic image registration based on a set of corresponding anatomical point landmarks and approximating thin-plate splines. This approach is an extension of the original interpolating thin-plate spline approach and allows to take into account landmark localization errors. The extension is important for clinical applications since landmark extraction is always prone to error. Our approach is based on a minimizing functional and can cope with isotropic as well as anisotropic landmark errors. In particular, in the latter case it is possible to include different types of landmarks, e.g., unique point landmarks as well as arbitrary edge points. Also, the scheme is general with respect to the image dimension and the order of smoothness of the underlying functional. Optimal affine transformations as well as interpolating thin-plate splines are special cases of this scheme. To localize landmarks we use a semi-automatic approach which is based on three-dimensional (3-D) differential operators. Experimental results are presented for two-dimensional as well as 3-D tomographic images of the human brain.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we present a new approach for the nonrigid registration of contrast-enhanced breast MRI. A hierarchical transformation model of the motion of the breast has been developed. The global motion of the breast is modeled by an affine transformation while the local breast motion is described by a free-form deformation (FFD) based on B-splines. Normalized mutual information is used as a voxel-based similarity measure which is insensitive to intensity changes as a result of the contrast enhancement. Registration is achieved by minimizing a cost function, which represents a combination of the cost associated with the smoothness of the transformation and the cost associated with the image similarity. The algorithm has been applied to the fully automated registration of three-dimensional (3-D) breast MRI in volunteers and patients. In particular, we have compared the results of the proposed nonrigid registration algorithm to those obtained using rigid and affine registration techniques. The results clearly indicate that the nonrigid registration algorithm is much better able to recover the motion and deformation of the breast than rigid or affine registration algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Imaging of gas distribution in the lungs of patients with asthma has been restricted because of the lack of a suitable gaseous contrast agent. Hyperpolarized helium-3 (HHe3) provides a new technique for magnetic resonance imaging of lung diseases. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the use of HHe3 gas to image the lungs of patients with moderate or severe asthma and to assess changes in gas distribution after methacholine and exercise challenge. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in asthmatic patients immediately after inhalation of HHe3 gas. In addition, images were obtained before and after methacholine challenge and a standard exercise test. RESULTS: Areas of the lung with no signal or sharply reduced HHe3 signal (ventilation defects) are common in patients with asthma, and the number of defects was inversely related to the percent predicted FEV(1) (r = 0.71, P <.002). After methacholine challenge (n = 3), the number of defects increased. Similarly, imaging of the lungs after exercise (n = 6) showed increased ventilation defects in parallel with decreases in FEV(1). The increase in defects after challenge in these 9 asthmatic patients was significant both for the number (P <.02) and extent (P <.02) of the defects. The variability and speed of changes in ventilation and the complete lack of signal in many areas is in keeping with a model in which the defects result from airway closure. CONCLUSION: HHe3 magnetic resonance provides a new technique for imaging the distribution of inhaled air in the lungs. The technique is suitable for following responses to treatment of asthma and changes after methacholine or exercise challenge.},

  Abstract                 = {Results from functional imaging studies are often still interpreted using the classical architectonic brain maps of Brodmann and his successors. One obvious weakness in traditional, architectural mapping is the subjective nature of localizing borders between cortical areas by means of a purely visual, microscopical examination of histological specimens. To overcome this limitation, objective mapping procedures based on quantitative cytoarchitecture have been generated. As a result, new maps for various species including man were established. In our contribution, principles of quantitative cytoarchitecture and algorithm-based cortical mapping are described for a cytoarchitectural parcellation of the human auditory cortex. Defining cortical borders based on quantified changes in cortical lamination is the decisive step towards a novel, highly improved probabilistic brain atlas.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a novel method for validation of nonrigid medical image registration. This method is based on the simulation of physically plausible, biomechanical tissue deformations using finite-element methods. Applying a range of displacements to finite-element models of different patient anatomies generates model solutions which simulate gold standard deformations. From these solutions, deformed images are generated with a range of deformations typical of those likely to occur in vivo. The registration accuracy with respect to the finite-element simulations is quantified by co-registering the deformed images with the original images and comparing the recovered voxel displacements with the biomechanically simulated ones. The functionality of the validation method is demonstrated for a previously described nonrigid image registration technique based on free-form deformations using B-splines and normalized mutual information as a voxel similarity measure, with an application to contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance mammography image pairs. The exemplar nonrigid registration technique is shown to be of subvoxel accuracy on average for this particular application. The validation method presented here is an important step toward more generic simulations of biomechanically plausible tissue deformations and quantification of tissue motion recovery using nonrigid image registration. It will provide a basis for improving and comparing different nonrigid registration techniques for a diversity of medical applications, such as intrasubject tissue deformation or motion correction in the brain, liver or heart.},

The method has the advantage that it can be applied at an early stage in an automated data analysis, before a tissue model is available. Described as nonparametric nonuniform intensity normalization (N3), the method is independent of pulse sequence and insensitive to pathological data that might otherwise violate model assumptions. To eliminate the dependence of the field estimate on anatomy, an iterative approach is employed to estimate both the multiplicative bias field and the distribution of the true tissue intensities. The performance of this method is evaluated using both real and simulated MR data.},

Our method combines and extends some of the best techniques available in the context of medical imaging. We express the deformation field as a B-spline model, which allows us to deal with a rich variety of deformations. We solve the registration problem by minimizing a pixelwise mean-square distance measure between the target image and the warped source. The problem is further constrained by way of a vector-spline regularization which provides some control over two independent quantities that are intrinsic to the deformation: its divergence, and its curl. Our algorithm is also able to handle soft landmark constraints, which is particularly useful when parts of the images contain very little information or when its repartition is uneven. We provide an optimal analytical solution in the case when only landmarks and smoothness considerations are taken into account. We have applied our approach to perform the elastic registration of images such as electrophoretic gels and fly embryos. The validation of the results by experts has been favorable in all cases.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The lungs of five healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats were imaged using hyperpolarized helium-3 magnetic resonance imaging. From these images, regional fractional ventilation was calculated and maps generated detailing the distribution of fractional ventilation in the lung. The 1.56 mm x 1.56 mm x 4 mm regions of interest were assigned on 5 cm x 5 cm field of view lung maps. Histograms were also generated showing the frequency distribution of fractional ventilation values. To compare fractional ventilation values between animals, the ventilation procedure was standardized to results from individual pulmonary function tests. Each animal's spontaneous tidal volume, respiratory rate, and inspiration percentage (percent of total respiratory cycle in inspiration) were used in their mechanical ventilation settings. RESULTS: Results were similar among all five healthy rats based on examination of ventilation distribution maps and frequency distribution histograms. Mean (0.13) and standard deviation (0.07) were calculated for fractional ventilation in each animal. However, these values were determined to be influenced by slice selection, and therefore the maps and histograms were favored in analysis of results.

  Abstract                 = {The correct diagnosis of asthma is usually easily made and most patients with asthma respond to therapy. Approximately 5\% of patients with asthma, however, have disease that is difficult to control despite taking maximal doses of inhaled medications. Patients with therapy-resistant or difficult-to-control asthma require a rigorous and systematic approach to their diagnosis and treatment. The first step is evaluation and testing directed at determining that asthma is the correct diagnosis. Many diseases mimic asthma and these alternate diagnoses should be considered. The second step is to identify and eliminate triggers that worsen asthma. Cigarette smoking, occupational exposures, and allergic rhinitis contribute to worsening disease. Most patients with "difficult asthma" require treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting inhaled beta(2)-agonists. Despite maximal inhaled therapy, these patients will require either frequent bursts or chronic daily therapy with oral corticosteroids. These patients may have "resistant" inflammation with a persistent inflammatory state. Numerous studies also suggest that compliance with asthma therapy is poor. Combination therapy with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta(2)-agonist in a single inhaler may improve patient compliance. In selected patients, additional therapy with leukotriene modifiers or anti-IgE antibody can result in improved asthma control and may allow tapering of corticosteroids. Use of methotrexate is not justified based on current data. Emerging evidence suggests that different phenotypes of difficult or therapy-resistant asthma exist. Recognition of these subgroups allows tailored therapy and prevents overmedication in an attempt to normalize lung function in patients with irreversible airflow obstruction.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a new approach to the correction of intensity inhomogeneities in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that significantly improves intensity-based tissue segmentation. The distortion of the image brightness values by a low-frequency bias field impedes visual inspection and segmentation. The new correction method called parametric bias field correction (PABIC) is based on a simplified model of the imaging process, a parametric model of tissue class statistics, and a polynomial model of the inhomogeneity field. We assume that the image is composed of pixels assigned to a small number of categories with a priori known statistics. Further we assume that the image is corrupted by noise and a low-frequency inhomogeneity field. The estimation of the parametric bias field is formulated as a nonlinear energy minimization problem using an evolution strategy (ES). The resulting bias field is independent of the image region configurations and thus overcomes limitations of methods based on homomorphic filtering. Furthermore, PABIC can correct bias distortions much larger than the image contrast. Input parameters are the intensity statistics of the classes and the degree of the polynomial function. The polynomial approach combines bias correction with histogram adjustment, making it well suited for normalizing the intensity histogram of datasets from serial studies. We present simulations and a quantitative validation with phantom and test images. A large number of MR image data acquired with breast, surface, and head coils, both in two dimensions and three dimensions, have been processed and demonstrate the versatility and robustness of this new bias correction scheme.},

  Abstract                 = {To evaluate impaired respiratory mechanics in pulmonary emphysema, dynamic breathing magnetic resonance imaging (BMRI) was acquired with fast-gradient echo pulse sequences at fixed thoracic planes over two to three slow, deep respiratory cycles in 6 controls and 28 patients with pulmonary emphysema including 9 patients undergoing lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). Respiratory motions of the diaphragm and chest wall (D/CW) were assessed by a cine-loop view, a fusion display of maximal inspiratory and expiratory images, and the time-distance curves. By contrast with normal subjects with regular synchronous D/CW motions, the patients frequently showed reduced, irregular, or asynchronous motions, with significant decreases in the maximal amplitude of D/CW motions (MAD and MACW), and the length of apposition of the diaphragm (LAD) (P < 0.0001, P < 0.001, P < 0. 01, respectively). After LVRS, nine patients showed improvements in D/CW configuration and mobility, with significantly increased MAD, MACW, and LAD (P < 0.01, P < 0.0001, and P < 0.05, respectively). In 40 studies of 28 patients including the post-LVRS examinations, the normalized MAD and MACW significantly correlated with \%FEV(1) (r = 0. 881 and r = 0.906; P < 0.0001, respectively). BMRI seems useful for noninvasively and directly assessing the impaired respiratory mechanics associated with abnormal ventilation in pulmonary emphysema, and also for monitoring the effects of LVRS.

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes the design, implementation and preliminary results of a technique for creating a comprehensive probabilistic atlas of the human brain based on high-dimensional vector field transformations. The goal of the atlas is to detect and quantify distributed patterns of deviation from normal anatomy, in a 3-D brain image from any given subject. The algorithm analyzes a reference population of normal scans and automatically generates color-coded probability maps of the anatomy of new subjects. Given a 3-D brain image of a new subject, the algorithm calculates a set of high-dimensional volumetric maps (with typically 384(2) x 256 x 3 approximately 10(8) degrees of freedom) elastically deforming this scan into structural correspondence with other scans, selected one by one from an anatomic image database. The family of volumetric warps thus constructed encodes statistical properties and directional biases of local anatomical variation throughout the architecture of the brain. A probability space of random transformations, based on the theory of anisotropic Gaussian random fields, is then developed to reflect the observed variability in stereotaxic space of the points whose correspondences are found by the warping algorithm. A complete system of 384(2) x 256 probability density functions is computed, yielding confidence limits in stereotaxic space for the location of every point represented in the 3-D image lattice of the new subject's brain. Color-coded probability maps are generated, densely defined throughout the anatomy of the new subject. These indicate locally the probability of each anatomic point being unusually situated, given the distributions of corresponding points in the scans of normal subjects. 3-D MRI and high-resolution cryosection volumes are analyzed from subjects with metastatic tumors and Alzheimer's disease. Gradual variations and continuous deformations of the underlying anatomy are simulated and their dynamic effects on regional probability maps are animated in video format (on the accompanying CD-ROM). Applications of the deformable probabilistic atlas include the transfer of multi-subject 3-D functional, vascular and histologic maps onto a single anatomic template, the mapping of 3-D atlases onto the scans of new subjects, and the rapid detection, quantification and mapping of local shape changes in 3-D medical images in disease and during normal or abnormal growth and development.},

  Abstract                 = {We present research in which both left and right ventricular deformation is estimated from tagged cardiac magnetic resonance imaging using volumetric deformable models constructed from nonuniform rational B-splines (NURBS). The four model types considered and compared for the left ventricle include two Cartesian NURBS models--one with a cylindrical parameter assignment and one with a prolate spheroidal parameter assignment. The remaining two are non-Cartesian, i.e., prolate spheroidal and cylindrical each with their respective prolate spheroidal and cylindrical parameter assignment regimes. These choices were made based on the typical shape of the left ventricle. For each frame starting with end-diastole, a NURBS model is constructed by fitting two surfaces with the same parameterization to the corresponding set of epicardial and endocardial contours from which a volumetric model is created. Using normal displacements of the three sets of orthogonal tag planes as well as displacements of contour/tag line intersection points and tag plane intersection points, one can solve for the optimal homogeneous coordinates, in a weighted least squares sense, of the control points of the deformed NURBS model at end-diastole using quadratic programming. This allows for subsequent nonrigid registration of the biventricular model at end-diastole to all later time frames. After registration of the model to all later time points, the registered NURBS models are temporally lofted in order to create a comprehensive four-dimensional NURBS model. From the lofted model, we can extract three-dimensional myocardial deformation fields and corresponding Lagrangian and Eulerian strain maps which are local measures of nonrigid deformation. The results show that, in the case of simulated data, the quadratic Cartesian NURBS models with the cylindrical and prolate spheroidal parameter assignments outperform their counterparts in predicting normal strain. The decreased complexity associated with the Cartesian model with the cylindrical parameter assignment prompted its use for subsequent calculations. Lagrangian strains in three canine data, a normal human, and a patient with history of myocardial infarction are presented. Eulerian strains for the normal human data are also included.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous contributions to both the research and open source software communities detailed a generalization of a fast scalar field fitting technique for cubic B-splines based on the work originally proposed by Lee . One advantage of our proposed generalized B-spline fitting approach is its immediate application to a class of nonrigid registration techniques frequently employed in medical image analysis. Specifically, these registration techniques fall under the rubric of free-form deformation (FFD) approaches in which the object to be registered is embedded within a B-spline object. The deformation of the B-spline object describes the transformation of the image registration solution. Representative of this class of techniques, and often cited within the relevant community, is the formulation of Rueckert who employed cubic splines with normalized mutual information to study breast deformation. Similar techniques from various groups provided incremental novelty in the form of disparate explicit regularization terms, as well as the employment of various image metrics and tailored optimization methods. For several algorithms, the underlying gradient-based optimization retained the essential characteristics of Rueckert's original contribution. The contribution which we provide in this paper is two-fold: 1) the observation that the generic FFD framework is intrinsically susceptible to problematic energy topographies and 2) that the standard gradient used in FFD image registration can be modified to a well-understood preconditioned form which substantially improves performance. This is demonstrated with theoretical discussion and comparative evaluation experimentation.},

  Abstract                 = {Current research investigating the modeling of left ventricular dynamics for accurate clinical assessment of cardiac function is extensive. Magnetic resonance (MR) tagging is a functional imaging method which allows for encoding of a grid of signal voids on cardiac MR images, providing a mechanism for noninvasive measurement of intramural tissue deformations, in vivo. We present a novel technique of employing a four-dimensional (4-D) B-spline model which permits concurrent determination of myocardial beads and myocardial strains. The method entails fitting the knot planes of the 4-D B-spline model for fixed times to a sequence of triplets of orthogonal sets of tag surfaces for all imaged volumetric frames within the constraints of the model's spatio-temporal internal energy. From a three-dimensional (3-D) displacement field, the corresponding long and short-axis Lagrangian normal, shear, and principal strain maps are produced. As an important byproduct, the points defined by the 3-D intersections of the triplets of orthogonal tag planes, which we refer to as myocardial beads, can easily be determined by our model. Displaying the beads as a movie loop allows for the visualization of the nonrigid movement of the left ventricle in 3-D.},

In the first part of this paper, we show that Thirion's demons algorithm can be seen as an optimization procedure on the entire space of displacement fields. We provide strong theoretical roots to the different variants of Thirion's demons algorithm. This analysis predicts a theoretical advantage for the symmetric forces variant of the demons algorithm. We show on controlled experiments that this advantage is confirmed in practice and yields a faster convergence. In the second part of this paper, we adapt the optimization procedure underlying the demons algorithm to a space of diffeomorphic transformations. In contrast to many diffeomorphic registration algorithms, our solution is computationally efficient since in practice it only replaces an addition of displacement fields by a few compositions. Our experiments show that in addition to being diffeomorphic, our algorithm provides results that are similar to the ones from the demons algorithm but with transformations that are much smoother and closer to the gold standard, available in controlled experiments, in terms of Jacobians.},

The relationships between these markers and the magnitude of structural changes of the airways in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were assessed. Induced sputum and HRCT scan were performed in 30 asthmatics (14 mild and 16 severe) and in 12 patients with COPD. A greater extent of HRCT scan abnormalities was found in COPD than in severe and mild asthmatics. HRCT scan abnormalities correlated with the degree of airway obstruction in COPD and in severe asthma. HRCT scan abnormalities also correlated with the levels of sputum elastase both in COPD and in severe asthma. HRCT scan abnormalities were associated with sputum MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio in mild asthma, severe asthma and COPD. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that sputum elastase and the metalloproteinase-9/tissue-inhibitor metalloproteinase-1 ratio are associated with the magnitude of high-resolution computed tomography scan abnormalities of the airways in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and suggests that the levels of these markers reflect the extent of structural changes of the airways.},

A SPAMM tagging sequence was modified to allow continuous dynamic imaging of the lungs during respiration. A motion-tracking algorithm was developed to track material regions from time-resolved grid-tagged images. Experiments were performed to image the lungs during quiet breathing and volumetric strain was calculated from the measured displacement maps. Regional volume calculations, derived from volumetric strain, were integrated over the entire lung and compared to segmented volume calculations with good agreement. Results from this work demonstrate that MRI spirometry has the potential to become a clinically useful tool for measuring regional ventilation and assessing pulmonary diseases that regionally affect the mechanical function of the lung.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents processing and visualization techniques for Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DT-MRI). In DT-MRI, each voxel is assigned a tensor that describes local water diffusion. The geometric nature of diffusion tensors enables us to quantitatively characterize the local structure in tissues such as bone, muscle, and white matter of the brain. This makes DT-MRI an interesting modality for image analysis. In this paper we present a novel analytical solution to the Stejskal-Tanner diffusion equation system whereby a dual tensor basis, derived from the diffusion sensitizing gradient configuration, eliminates the need to solve this equation for each voxel. We further describe decomposition of the diffusion tensor based on its symmetrical properties, which in turn describe the geometry of the diffusion ellipsoid. A simple anisotropy measure follows naturally from this analysis. We describe how the geometry or shape of the tensor can be visualized using a coloring scheme based on the derived shape measures. In addition, we demonstrate that human brain tensor data when filtered can effectively describe macrostructural diffusion, which is important in the assessment of fiber-tract organization. We also describe how white matter pathways can be monitored with the methods introduced in this paper. DT-MRI tractography is useful for demonstrating neural connectivity (in vivo) in healthy and diseased brain tissue.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All study participants were assessed with spirometry prior to imaging. 3-He images were collected during an arrested breath hold, after inhaling a mixture of 200 mL of hyperpolarized 3-He/800 mL of N2. Proton SSFSE images were acquired after inhaling 1 liter of room air. The ventilated volume for each study participant was calculated from the 3-He images, and a ratio was calculated to give a percentage ventilated lung volume. RESULTS: Never-smokers exhibited a 90\% mean ventilated volume. The mean ventilated lung volumes for healthy smokers and smokers diagnosed with COPD were 75.2\% and 67.6\%, respectively. No correlation with spirometry was demonstrated for either of the smoking groups. CONCLUSION: Combined 3-He/Proton SSFSE MRI of the lungs is a noninvasive method, using nonionizing radiation, which demonstrates ventilated airspaces and enables the calculation of ventilated lung volumes. This method appears to be sensitive to early obstructive changes in the lungs of smokers.},

  Abstract                 = {Active contour segmentation and its robust implementation using level set methods are well-established theoretical approaches that have been studied thoroughly in the image analysis literature. Despite the existence of these powerful segmentation methods, the needs of clinical research continue to be fulfilled, to a large extent, using slice-by-slice manual tracing. To bridge the gap between methodological advances and clinical routine, we developed an open source application called ITK-SNAP, which is intended to make level set segmentation easily accessible to a wide range of users, including those with little or no mathematical expertise. This paper describes the methods and software engineering philosophy behind this new tool and provides the results of validation experiments performed in the context of an ongoing child autism neuroimaging study. The validation establishes SNAP intrarater and interrater reliability and overlap error statistics for the caudate nucleus and finds that SNAP is a highly reliable and efficient alternative to manual tracing. Analogous results for lateral ventricle segmentation are provided.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a postprocessing tool to quantify ventilated split-lung volumes on the basis of (3)He-MRI and to apply it in patients after single-lung transplantation (SLTX). High-resolution CT (HRCT) was employed as a reference modality providing split air-filled lung volumes. Lung volumes derived from pulmonary function test results served as clinical parameters and were used as the "gold standard." MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight patients (mean age, 54 years) with emphysema and six patients (mean age, 58 years) with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. All patients were evaluated following SLTX. HRCT was performed during inspiration (slice thickness, 1 mm; increment, 10 mm). For correlation with (3)He-MRI, HRCT images were reconstructed in coronal orientation to match the same anatomic levels. Aerated lung was determined by threshold-based segmentation of CT. (3)He-MRI was performed on a 1.5-T scanner using a two-dimensional, fast low-angle shot sequence in coronal orientation covering the whole lung after inhalation of a 300-mL bolus of hyperpolarized (3)He gas followed by normal room air for the rest of the tidal volume. Lung segmentation on (3)He-MRI was done using different thresholds. RESULTS: In emphysematous patients, (3)He-MRI showed excellent correlation (r = 0.9) with vital capacity, while CT correlated (r = 0.8) with total lung capacity. (3)He-MRI correlated well with CT (r > 0.8) for grafts and native fibrotic lungs. In emphysematous lungs, MRI showed a good correlation (r = 0.7) with the nonemphysematous lung volume from CT. Increasing thresholds in (3)He-MRI reveal differences between aerated and ventilated lung areas with a different distribution in emphysema and fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: (3)He-MRI is superior to CT in emphysema to demonstrate ventilated lung areas that participate in gas exchange. In fibrosis, (3)He-MRI and CT have a similar impact. The decrease pattern and the intraindividual ratio between ventilation of native and transplanted lungs will have to be investigated as a new surrogate for the ventilatory follow-up in patients undergoing SLTX.},

  Abstract                 = {Spatial normalization of diffusion tensor images plays a key role in voxel-based analysis of white matter (WM) group differences. Currently, it has been achieved using low-dimensional registration methods in the large majority of clinical studies. This paper aims to motivate the use of high-dimensional normalization approaches by generating evidence of their impact on the findings of such studies. Using an ongoing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) study, we evaluated three normalization methods representing the current range of available approaches: low-dimensional normalization using the fractional anisotropy (FA), high-dimensional normalization using the FA, and high-dimensional normalization using full tensor information. Each method was assessed in terms of its ability to detect significant differences between ALS patients and controls. Our findings suggest that inadequate normalization with low-dimensional approaches can result in insufficient removal of shape differences which in turn can confound FA differences in a complex manner, and that utilizing high-dimensional normalization can both significantly minimize the confounding effect of shape differences to FA differences and provide a more complete description of WM differences in terms of both size and tissue architecture differences. We also found that high-dimensional approaches, by leveraging full tensor features instead of tensor-derived indices, can further improve the alignment of WM tracts.},
